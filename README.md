 Create an AVD

    Launch the Android Virtual Device Manager:
        In Android Studio, select Tools > Android > AVD Manager, or click the AVD Manager icon in the toolbar. The AVD Manager screen appears.
        Or, from the command line, change directories to sdk/ and execute:

        tools/android avd

        Note: The AVD Manager that appears when launched from the command line is different from the version in Android Studio, so the following instructions may not all apply.
    On the AVD Manager main screen, click Create Virtual Device.
    In the Select Hardware window, select a device configuration, such as Nexus 6, then click Next.
    Select the desired system version for the AVD and click Next.
    Verify the configuration settings, then click Finish.
